# Analysis of India's Utility Power Installed Capacity Growth

## Overview

This project involved web scraping data on the growth of installed power capacity in India (specifically for utility power) using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. The scraped data was then saved to a CSV file on a local machine. Subsequently, the project focused on Data Cleaning and Preparation, followed by Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to visualize the trends in India's power sector.

## Project Steps

1.  **Web Scraping:** Utilized BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data on installed power capacity from a specified web source.
2.  **Data Storage:** The scraped data was saved into a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file on the local file system for further processing.
3.  **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Performed necessary data cleaning steps, which may have included handling missing values, correcting data types, and structuring the data for analysis.
4.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conducted EDA to gain insights into the growth patterns of different energy sources in India's utility power sector. This involved plotting various graphs:
    * **Thermal Energy Growth in India (Bar Plot):** Visualized the growth trend of installed capacity from thermal energy sources over time using a bar chart.
    * **Renewable Energy Growth in India (Bar Plot):** Illustrated the growth trend of installed capacity from renewable energy sources over time using a bar chart.
    * **Thermal Energy Growth of Installed Capacity in India (Pie Chart):** Displayed the proportion of the total installed capacity contributed by different thermal energy sources (e.g., coal, gas, nuclear) using a pie chart.
    * **Renewable Energy Growth of Installed Capacity in India (Pie Chart):** Showcased the proportion of the total installed capacity contributed by different renewable energy sources (e.g., solar, wind, hydro) using a pie chart.

## Key Visualizations

The exploratory data analysis generated the following key visualizations:

* **Thermal Energy Growth Trend (Bar Plot):** Provides a clear picture of how thermal power capacity has evolved over the years.
* **Renewable Energy Growth Trend (Bar Plot):** Highlights the progress and expansion of renewable energy capacity in India.
* **Thermal Energy Mix (Pie Chart):** Shows the relative contribution of different thermal sources to the total installed capacity.
* **Renewable Energy Mix (Pie Chart):** Illustrates the share of various renewable energy technologies in the overall renewable capacity.

## Conclusion

This project successfully extracted, cleaned, and analyzed data related to the growth of installed utility power capacity in India. The generated visualizations provide valuable insights into the historical trends and the current composition of India's power sector, particularly highlighting the growth of both thermal and renewable energy sources and their respective contributions to the total installed capacity. This analysis can be beneficial for policymakers, energy companies, and researchers interested in understanding India's energy landscape.
